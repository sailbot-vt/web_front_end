## Development

Ensure that Node.js and Yarn are installed on your machine.

After cloning the repo, navigate to the directory and run `yarn`. This will install all dependencies.

Use `yarn add <dependency>` to install new packages.

Use `yarn serve` to run the Webpack development server. This has all kinds of features that make it easy and fast to develop Node.js apps. Go to http://localhost:8080 to view the website on the development machine, or use the network address to view it from any device on the same local network. The Webpack server has all sorts of cool features. Read about it on the Vue CLI or the Webpack documentation.

The Vue.js docs are some of the best I've ever read â€“ read them.
